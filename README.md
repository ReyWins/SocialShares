# How To Use Social Media Share Links in an Astro Component! üöÄ

This is a simple demonstration on how we utilize the {Astro.url} function to grab our Astro websites URLs. This use case scenario is extremly helpful and easy for those who want to touch up their blog posts with a few easy steps. Since the JavaScript function returns the current page URL from the Request object, it gives us the data we need in order to convert it into a shareable URL. With the power of Astro, we've created a component file called "SocialShare.astro". This will give us the proper html clode that imports and utilize the JavaScript. 

The goal of this is to share my knoweldge with all new Astronauts üßë‚ÄçüöÄ and those who are more seasoned!

Feel free to adjust add any features you seem fit. Please reference this Github page if you do, so we can all contribute this is very useful tool.

I plan on updating this more whenever I have more free time.

Enjoy!

## üöÄ Recommended Installation Paths

Below is the correct suggested path that you should use this Astro file as well as the JS script. 
Note, you can place the JS file in whichever flow you currently have.

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SocialShare.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ share.js
/
```

## Share.js Script:
```
export function getShareUrl(platform, url) {
    let shareUrl = '';
  
    switch (platform) {
      case 'facebook':
        shareUrl = `https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`;
        break;
      case 'twitter':
        shareUrl = `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`;
        break;
      case 'linkedin':
        shareUrl = `https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`;
        break;
      default:
        console.error(`Invalid platform: ${platform}`);
        break;
    }
  
    return shareUrl;
  }
  
```
> The javascript includes the correct URL share syntax that is used by various Social Media companies. You can simply add different types of social media links as long as you have the correct URL path and syntax. Simply add another switch statement to the existing file.

## SocialShare.astro Component
```
---
import { getShareUrl } from '../share.js';
import Icon from 'astro-icon';
---
<center>
<div class="share">
<ul>
    <li><a href={getShareUrl('facebook', Astro.url)} target="_blank" rel="noopener"><Icon name=facebook width="35px" /></a></li>  
        <li><a href={getShareUrl('twitter', Astro.url)} target="_blank" rel="noopener"><Icon name=twitter width="35px" /></a></li>
            <li><a href={getShareUrl('linkedin', Astro.url)} target="_blank" rel="noopener"><Icon name=linkedin width="35px" /></a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</center>

```
> Import the *share.js* file and simply create an Unordered List tag to the amount of social media links you would like to use. You can customize this file based upon existing CSS styling.
> For our example, we've used Astro Icon to add a simple yet effective way to show off the social media links.
> Notice that we are using [Astro.url](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#astrourl) to return the URL path of your current website.
> This is where the magic ü™Ñ happens.

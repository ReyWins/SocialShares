# Social Media Share in Astro 🚀 & JS
```
This is a simple demonstration on how we utilize that {Astro.url} function to grab our websites (ex: blog, post, etc...) URL since the function returns the current page URL from the Request object. With the power of Astro, we've created a seperate *.astro file called "SocialShare.astro". This will give us the proper html clode that calls the JS script to activate each time we reference it from the custom *.JS file. We provide more details below.

The goal of this is to share my knoweldge with all new Astronauts

## 🚀 Recommended Istallation Paths

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── SocialShare.astro
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── share.js
/
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
